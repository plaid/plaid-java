# Releasing a new version to Maven Central Repository

Plaid-java is available at [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cplaid-java)

## Setting up your Sonatype account

To deploy a new version, you need a Sonatype account. 
Sign up for an account [here](https://issues.sonatype.org/secure/Signup!default.jspa) with your plaid.com email.

Afterwards, ask someone (davidzhanghp@) to file a ticket like [OSSRH-39496](https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-39496) for you.

This may take some time as we rely on folks at Sonatype to do this for us, so please be patient.

## Setting up ~/.m2/settings.xml
We need to take your credentials from Sonatype and add it to your `~/.m2/settings.xml`. Maven reads `~/.m2/settings.xml` for user-specific configuration.

Using the editor of your choice, paste this into your `~/.m2/settings.xml` file, replacing the username and password.

Fun fact: XML won't like it if your password contains illegal XML characters, so you probably need to escape it. Alternatively, just change your password to be more XML-friendly.

```
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <username>sonatypeusername</username>
      <password>>>iLoveHotPot123!@HenrysHunan</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>ossrh</id>
      <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
      </activation>
      <properties>
        <gpg.executable>gpg2</gpg.executable>
        <gpg.useagent>true</gpg.useagent>
      </properties>
    </profile>
  </profiles>
</settings>
```   

## Installing maven

If you haven't, you need to install maven. Maven is a build and dependency management system.  

```
brew install maven
```

Even though the system is commonly known as maven, the binary is `mvn`.

## Setting up a GPG key
As part of the maven artifact signing process, you need a gpg key set up locally. If you have not done this, run the following command

```
gpg --gen-key
```

Fill out the prompts and you'll have a new gpg key generated locally. You can confirm this by running `gpg --list-keys`. Your new key should appear at the bottom.

You may see something like this.

```
pub   rsa2048 2018-05-01 [SC] [expires: 2020-04-30]
      464ADCDE06A6F2D4BCCBCD601B8EB73128C3987A
uid           [ultimate] First Last <flast@plaid.com>
sub   rsa2048 2018-05-01 [E] [expires: 2020-04-30]
```

In the above example, `464ADCDE06A6F2D4BCCBCD610B8EB73128C3987A` is the identifier for the key. 

Later on in the process, your public key will be verified against one of several online key repos. To upload yours, run this

`gpg --send-keys <key identifier from above>`.

## Publishing the new version
`cd` to `plaid-java` and create a new branch. This is important because mvn tries to push using your branch and you most likely can't push to master directly.

After you have your new branch, run the following to make sure that our tests pass:
```bash
mvn verify
```

Now run the following on the new branch:

```bash
PLAID_PUBLIC_KEY=insertpublickeyhere \ 
PLAID_SECRET=insertsecrethere \
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=insertclientidhere \ 
mvn release:prepare

PLAID_PUBLIC_KEY=insertpublickey\ 
PLAID_SECRET=insertsecrethere \
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=insertclientidhere \ 
mvn release:perform
```  

If things go wrong, run `mvn release:rollback` and re-execute the above commands.

If things go right, this will release a new artifact with a bumped patch version to the Sonatype staging maven repository.

### Check that the artifact is released

Login [here](https://oss.sonatype.org/#welcome) using your credentials from [above](#setting-up-your-sonatype-account). Try searching for "com.plaid" in the search bar and see if the newest version is in the "release" repository. If it is, the release is out! It may take a couple of hours to propagate to other Maven repositories, so just hang out and check on the [Central Maven Repository](https://search.maven.org/) in a few hours.

### Updating the documentation (don't forget this).

1. Update README.md with the latest version.
1. Update CHANGELOG.md.

At this point, merge your branch with master, and you should be all set!
