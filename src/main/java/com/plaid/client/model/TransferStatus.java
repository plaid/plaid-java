/**
 * The status of the transfer.  &#x60;pending&#x60;: A new transfer was created; it is in the pending state. &#x60;posted&#x60;: The transfer has been successfully submitted to the payment network. &#x60;settled&#x60;: The transfer was successfully completed by the payment network. Note that funds from received debits are not available to be moved out of the Ledger until the transfer reaches &#x60;funds_available&#x60; status. For credit transactions, &#x60;settled&#x60; means the funds have been delivered to the receiving bank account. This is the terminal state of a successful credit transfer. &#x60;funds_available&#x60;: Funds from the transfer have been released from hold and applied to the ledger&#39;s available balance. (Only applicable to ACH debits.) This is the terminal state of a successful debit transfer. &#x60;cancelled&#x60;: The transfer was cancelled by the client. This is the terminal state of a cancelled transfer. &#x60;failed&#x60;: The transfer failed, no funds were moved. This is the terminal state of a failed transfer. &#x60;returned&#x60;: A posted transfer was returned. This is the terminal state of a returned transfer.
