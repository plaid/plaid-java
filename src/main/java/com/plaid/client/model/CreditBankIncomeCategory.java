/**
 * The income category.  &#x60;BANK_INTEREST&#x60;: Interest earned from a bank account. &#x60;BENEFIT_OTHER&#x60;: Government benefits other than retirement, unemployment, child support, or disability. Currently used only in the UK, to represent benefits such as Cost of Living Payments. &#x60;CASH&#x60;: Deprecated and used only for existing legacy implementations. Has been replaced by &#x60;CASH_DEPOSIT&#x60; and &#x60;TRANSFER_FROM_APPLICATION&#x60;. &#x60;CASH_DEPOSIT&#x60;: A cash or check deposit. &#x60;CHILD_SUPPORT&#x60;: Child support payments received. &#x60;GIG_ECONOMY&#x60;: Income earned as a gig economy worker, e.g. driving for Uber, Lyft, Postmates, DoorDash, etc. &#x60;LONG_TERM_DISABILITY&#x60;: Disability payments, including Social Security disability benefits. &#x60;OTHER&#x60;: Income that could not be categorized as any other income category. &#x60;MILITARY&#x60;: Veterans benefits. Income earned as salary for serving in the military (e.g. through DFAS) will be classified as &#x60;SALARY&#x60; rather than &#x60;MILITARY&#x60;.  &#x60;RENTAL&#x60;: Income earned from a rental property. Income may be identified as rental when the payment is received through a rental platform, e.g. Airbnb; rent paid directly by the tenant to the property owner (e.g. via cash, check, or ACH) will typically not be classified as rental income.  &#x60;RETIREMENT&#x60;: Payments from private retirement systems, pensions, and government retirement programs, including Social Security retirement benefits. &#x60;SALARY&#x60;: Payment from an employer to an earner or other form of permanent employment. &#x60;TAX_REFUND&#x60;: A tax refund. &#x60;TRANSFER_FROM_APPLICATION&#x60;: Deposits from a money transfer app, such as Venmo, Cash App, or Zelle. &#x60;UNEMPLOYMENT&#x60;: Unemployment benefits.
