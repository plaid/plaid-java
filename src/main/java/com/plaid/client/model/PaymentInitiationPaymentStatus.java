/**
 * The status of the payment.  Core lifecycle statuses:  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_INPUT_NEEDED&#x60;: **Transitional.** The payment is awaiting user input to continue processing. It may re-enter this state if additional input is required.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_AUTHORISING&#x60;: **Transitional.** The payment is being authorised by the financial institution. It will automatically move on once authorisation completes.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED&#x60;: **Transitional.** The payment has been authorised and accepted by the financial institution and is now in transit. A payment should be considered complete once it reaches the &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED&#x60; state or the funds settle in the recipient account.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED&#x60;: **Terminal.** The funds have left the payer’s account and the payment is en route to settlement. Support is more common in the UK than in the EU; where unsupported, a successful payment remains in &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_INITIATED&#x60; before settling. When using Plaid Virtual Accounts, &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_EXECUTED&#x60; is not terminal—the payment will continue to &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_SETTLED&#x60; once funds are available.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_SETTLED&#x60;: **Terminal.** The funds are available in the recipient’s account. Only available to customers using [Plaid Virtual Accounts](https://plaid.com/docs/payment-initiation/virtual-accounts/).  Failure statuses:  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS&#x60;: **Terminal.** The payment failed due to insufficient funds. No further retries will succeed until the payer’s balance is replenished.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_FAILED&#x60;: **Terminal (retryable).** The payment could not be initiated due to a system error or outage. Retry once the root cause is resolved.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_BLOCKED&#x60;: **Terminal (retryable).** The payment was blocked by Plaid (e.g., flagged as risky). Resolve any compliance or risk issues and retry.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_REJECTED&#x60;: **Terminal.** The payment was rejected by the financial institution. No automatic retry is possible.  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_CANCELLED&#x60;: **Terminal.** The end user cancelled the payment during authorisation.  Standing-order statuses:  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_ESTABLISHED&#x60;: **Terminal.** A recurring/standing order has been successfully created.  Deprecated (to be removed in a future release):  &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_UNKNOWN&#x60;: The payment status is unknown.    &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_PROCESSING&#x60;: The payment is currently being processed.    &#x60;PAYMENT_STATUS_COMPLETED&#x60;: Indicates that the standing order has been successfully established.
