/**
 * The network or rails used for the transfer.  For transfers submitted as &#x60;ach&#x60;, the next-day cutoff is 5:30 PM Eastern Time.  For transfers submitted as &#x60;same-day-ach&#x60;, the same-day cutoff is 3:30 PM Eastern Time. If the transfer is submitted after this cutoff but before the next-day cutoff, it will be sent over next-day rails and will not incur same-day charges; this will apply to both legs of the transfer if applicable.  For transfers submitted as &#x60;rtp&#x60;,  Plaid will automatically route between Real Time Payment rail by TCH or FedNow rails as necessary. If a transfer is submitted as &#x60;rtp&#x60; and the counterparty account is not eligible for RTP, the &#x60;/transfer/authorization/create&#x60; request will fail with an &#x60;INVALID_FIELD&#x60; error code. To pre-check to determine whether a counterparty account can support RTP, call &#x60;/transfer/capabilities/get&#x60; before calling &#x60;/transfer/authorization/create&#x60;.  Wire transfers are currently in early availability. To request access to &#x60;wire&#x60; as a payment network, contact your Account Manager. For transfers submitted as &#x60;wire&#x60;, the &#x60;type&#x60; must be &#x60;credit&#x60;; wire debits are not supported.
